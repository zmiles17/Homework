# Instructions

> Today is going to be a different kind of class, so prepare yourself. Traditional education often involves rote memorization and specific formulas, but that doesn't work when you're learning to be a developer. Today is about taking your first dip into the deep end of independent learning. You'll need to Google. You'll need to rely heavily on your teammates. You'll need to ask for help when you get stuck. But you can do this! Hard practice, though frustrating at times, is where the greatest learning takes place!
